# ML_programs
>These are some of the programs tried to analyse and see how a machine learning code works
>The first program in this is finding future stock values using regression from sklearn. 
>The same file also has the actual algorithm for regression.
>The second one is to use KNN for classification algorithm on the cancer data that is provided in the folder.
>KNN from sklearn gave me an accuracy of 94%
>While the same KNN algorithm written by me gave an accuracy of 91% for the same data set.
>The third one is to use SVM to solve the same cancer dataset which gave me anaccuracy of 96%.
>The algorthm for SVM which was copied from [OPTIMIZING SVM](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf).This was to understand how kernel worked for the same dataset.This gave me an accuracy of 93%
All these three were coded in python 2.7.x
