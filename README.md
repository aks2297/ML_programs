# ML_programs
1.These are some of the programs tried to analyse and see how a machine learning code works

2.The first program in this is finding future stock values using regression from sklearn. 

3.The same file also has the actual algorithm for regression.

4.The second one is to use KNN for classification algorithm on the cancer data that is provided in the folder.

5.KNN from sklearn gave me an accuracy of 94%

6.While the same KNN algorithm written by me gave an accuracy of 91% for the same data set.

7.The third one is to use SVM to solve the same cancer dataset which gave me anaccuracy of 96%.

8.The algorthm for SVM which was copied from [OPTIMIZING SVM](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf).This was to 
understand how kernel worked for the same dataset.This gave me an accuracy of 93%

9.All these three were coded in python 2.7.x
